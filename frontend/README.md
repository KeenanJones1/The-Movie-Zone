## Lessons Learned

This was project was used as my introduction to react-spring. I wanted to take this opportunity to practice using animations.
Even though the animations I used were rudimentary I learned the fundamentals and enjoyed myself while doing so. The biggest obstracles this project provided were just understand the flow of API request I wanted to make and where to place them to be most efficient.
